Angular 2: The three types of directives

n many ways Angular 2 is simpler than the previous version. Directives are now the focal point and easier to create and maintain. In the previous version of Angular directives were a soar topic. Some people altogether avoided using them. Most eventually took the plunge to figure them out, but they always remained awkward. They are now first class citizens, so letâ€™s take a high level look at them in TypeScript.

There are 3 types of directives:

Components
Structural Directives
Attribute Directives


Structural & Attribute Directives
Rather than adding new DOM elements, both these types of directives modify the existing DOM and do not have templates.


2. Attribute Directive
Examples of built-in attribute directives that ship with Angular 2 are ngStyle and ngClass. As mentioned before, these directives modify the DOM and we are going to do the same in a simple custom attribute directive of our own. The naming convention for directives is: name.directive.ts
